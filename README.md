***jars-flux*** provides a clean and modular way to implement the flux design pattern in your React & React-Native applications. This library makes it possible to keep relavant reducer functions, actions as well as async operations with the React component they belong to.

***jars-flux*** uses Redux-Saga to handle async operations.
