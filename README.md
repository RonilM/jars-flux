***jars-flux*** provides a clean and modular way to implement the flux design pattern in your React & React-Native applications. This library makes it possible to keep relavant reducer functions, actions as well as async operations with the React component they belong to. If they are used in multiple components, then it is advisable to keep them with the common parent.

This library also handles deletion of data which belongs to unmounted components.

***jars-flux*** uses Redux-Saga to handle async operations.
